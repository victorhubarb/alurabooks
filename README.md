## Project Description
AluraBooks is an interactive digital library platform designed to cater to avid readers and book enthusiasts. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website allows users to browse, purchase, and manage a personal collection of books across various categories. With its user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation, AluraBooks offers a seamless online book-shopping experience, where users can also mark books as favorites and manage their bookshelves. Books and filtering methods on the "My Shelf" page are dynamically loaded and managed through JavaScript, using data retrieved from an external API.

## Features and Application Demonstration
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Includes a top navigation bar with a clickable logo redirecting to the home page, dropdown menus for book categories, and direct links to the user's bookshelf and shopping cart.
- **Book Categories Dropdown**: A clickable dropdown menu under 'Categories' in the main navigation, offering subcategories like Front-End, Back-End, and more, enhancing the book search experience.
- **Filtering Options on My Shelf**: On the "Minha estante" page, users can filter books by specific categories (e.g., Front-End, Back-End), availability, and price. These filtering options are implemented through JavaScript and are powered by data from an external API. Unavailable books are shown with increased opacity to distinguish them easily from available ones.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar is included for users to search for books by keywords. Note: This feature is visual-only in the current version.
- **Latest Releases Carousel**: Displays newly released books in a carousel that users can navigate by clicking and dragging.
- **Bestsellers Carousel**: Showcases best-selling books in a similar interactive carousel format.
- **Recently Visited Topics**: Quick access buttons for recently visited topics like Android, Agile, HTML, and CSS, enhancing user interaction and accessibility.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the platform is fully responsive and accessible on various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **Footer Links**: Includes useful links to other websites in the Alura group and community channels, enriching the user's experience and providing additional resources.
